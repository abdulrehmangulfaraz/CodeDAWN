Stop switching contexts. CodeDawn is a minimalist AI assistant that integrates directly into your editor, providing powerful, context-aware code suggestions without the clutter of traditional AI tools.

## Why CodeDawn?

In a world of complex AI tools, CodeDawn is designed with a simple philosophy: **great tools stay out of your way.** It's built for developers who want intelligent assistance without leaving their coding flow. No intrusive popups, no unnecessary UI—just the help you need, right when you need it.

## Key Features

-   **🧠 Context-Aware Intelligence:** CodeDawn automatically detects your selected code and file type, providing highly relevant and accurate suggestions.
-   **⚡️ Frictionless Workflow:** Invoke the AI with a single hotkey (`Ctrl+L` / `Cmd+L`). Type your request, press Enter, and watch the code appear directly in your editor.
-   **🚀 Dual AI Engine Support:** Get the best of both worlds. CodeDawn uses Google's powerful **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for high-quality results and can fall back on the lightning-fast **Groq (LLaMA3)**.
-   **✍️ Direct Code Insertion:** Generated code replaces your selected text or is inserted at your cursor, seamlessly integrating with your work.

## How to Use

1.  **Invoke:** Press `Ctrl+L` (or `Cmd+L` on Mac).
2.  **Request:** Type what you need. For example:
    -   _"refactor this function to use async/await"_
    -   _"add JSDoc comments"_
    -   _"convert this JSON to a TypeScript interface"_
3.  **Receive:** Press `Enter`. The code appears in your editor.

## Quick Setup

1.  **Install:** Find "CodeDawn" in the VS Code Extensions panel and click Install.
2.  **Configure API Key:**
    -   Open Settings (`File > Preferences > Settings`) and search for "CodeDawn".
    -   Enter your API key for **Gemini** (recommended) or **Groq**. The extension will use the key that you provide.
    -   You can get free keys from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) or [GroqCloud Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
